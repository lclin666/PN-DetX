# PN-DetX
This is the implementation for our [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ad2013): Pulmonary nodule detection in x-ray images by feature augmentation and context aggregation.

This implementation is based on the official ultralytics repository for [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), and only requires modifying the files in the corresponding directories.

The dataset used in this paper is located in our another repository [LAPNOD](https://github.com/lclin666/LAPNOD).
