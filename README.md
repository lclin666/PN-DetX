# PN-DetX
This is the implementation for paper: Pulmonary nodule detection in x-ray images by feature augmentation and context aggregation.

This implementation is based on the official ultralytics repository for YOLOv8, and only requires modifying the files in the corresponding directories.

The dataset used in this paper is located in our another repository [LAPNOD](https://github.com/lclin666/LAPNOD).
